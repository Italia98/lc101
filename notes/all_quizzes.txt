1. a python list named fruit that includes three strings: apple, banana, and orange. fruist=[“apple”,”banana”,”orange”]

2.Make a nested list named items_for_sale that includes a list of two cars (Ford and Honda) and a list of two movies (Star Wars and Independence Day)
items_for_sale = [[“Ford”,”Honda”],[“Star Wars”,”Independence Day”]]


3.What would have to be true about a list for this code to work properly?
exampleList[1][1][1]
exampleList=[“hello”,[10,(“red”,”pink”)]]

4.Why is the first print line False but the second print line is True?
x = ["a","b"] y = ["a","b"] print (x is y) print(x == y)
False; because ‘x’ and ‘y’ have the same value but they are not referring to the same object.
True; because they are equal on the same value .

5.What prints in the following statements?
a = [81,82,83] b = a print(a is b)
True

6.Given the following statements, what is printed?
a = [81,82,83] b = a a[1] = 17 print(a + b)
[81, 17, 83, 81, 17, 83]

7.Suppose you have a list of items named cars that contains strings for “Ford”,”Honda”, and “Toyota”. Suppose you also have a list of items named planes that contains strings for “737” and “747”.
Create a function that can take either list as an input parameter and print out each item in the list. Call the function for both lists.

def print_list():     
    cars =["Ford","Honda","Toyota"]
    planes = ["737","747"]
    cars += planes

8.Explain what a key-value pair is, and where you might use one in Python.
A key-value pair is use on Dictionaries and the  way the are defined is that the “key” that is a string is giving a value or a reference to the “value” which could be a string as well or an integer.


9.In the following code, what line number(s) showcase initialization?
0 import turtle 1 wn = turtle.Screen()  2 wn.bgcolor("lightgreen") 3 4 tess = turtle.Turtle()  5 tess.color("hotpink") 6 tess.pensize(5) 7 8 tess.forward(80)  9 tess.left(120)

10.Explain the relationship between classes and objects.
Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are essentially a way  to create your objects. A class is typically defined  to describe an object. An object is created when a class is instantiated.

11.What is inheritance and why is it a useful concept?

Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive the properties from another class , is it very useful because it allows us to reuse a code so we don’t have to rewrite the same code again and again ; we can also add more features to a class without modifying it.

12.Complete the following starter code such that the function call works and returns a value of 6.
# Complete the following starter code
def time_between_months(startingmonth, endingmonth):
     # todo define months as a dictionary
    months = {"January":1,"February":2,"March":3,"April":4,"May":5,"June":6,"July":7,
               "August":8,"September":9,"October":10,"November":11,"December":12}
    tbm = months[startingmonth] - months[endingmonth]
    return abs(tbm)

print(time_between_months("May","November"))
